# The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need

This repo contains my notes that I took throughout working with this (https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/introduction/) course by one and only @ThePrimeagen.

I plan on trying out those things both in TypeScript and Rust, I'll also attach any handwritten notes that I might take during the lessons.

### Disclaimers
- I already tooke the A&DS course on my Uni, so I can skip some parts that I'll find I'm already satisfied with.
- Idk how long it will take for me to finish this, as I need to keep up with my work, engineering thesis project, japanese learning and life in general. I just do this for fun basically (and also to get used to Neovim)
